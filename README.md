Over the past year, I developed an interest in figure collecting and noticed there weren’t many tools to easily compare my collection with what’s available. To solve this, I decided to build an application that combines C# and SQL Server for backend functionality, integrates eBay Web APIs for dynamic pricing and detailed information, and will feature a React-based frontend in the future.

Through this project, I’ve expanded my knowledge in areas such as client IDs and secrets, token authentication, and the principles of separation of concerns.
